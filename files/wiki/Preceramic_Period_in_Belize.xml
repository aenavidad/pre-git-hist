The '''Preceramic Period''' of [[history of Belize|Belizean]] and [[history of Mesoamerica|Mesoamerican]] history began with the arrival of the first [[Palaeoindian|Palaeoindians]] during 20000 BC{{snd}}11000 BC, and ended with the [[Mayan]] development of ceramics during 2000 BC{{snd}}900 BC.{{notetag|Preceramic Period dated 11500{{spaces}}BC{{snd}}900{{spaces}}BC by {{harvnb|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|pp=416-417}}, 20000{{spaces}}BC{{snd}}2000{{spaces}}BC or 12000{{spaces}}BC{{snd}}2000{{spaces}}BC by {{harvnb|Sharer|Traxler|2006|pp=98, 153-154}}, 35000{{spaces}}BC{{snd}}1500{{spaces}}BC or 10000{{spaces}}BC{{snd}}1500{{spaces}}BC by {{harvnb|Adams|Macleod|2000a|p=10}}, 35000{{spaces}}BC{{snd}}2300{{spaces}}BC by {{harvnb|Pearsall|2008|pp=163-164}}. However, {{harvnb|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|p=417}} note that ceramics in northern and central Belize have been dated to circa 1200 BC, such that an end period of 900 BC for the Preceramic 'may be too recent.' Additionally, {{harvnb|Adams|Macleod|2000a|p=47}} note that 2300 BC 'marks the end of the Preceramic era and, by strict definition, the close of the Archaic[; however, s]ome prehistorians reason that the Archaic period in Mesoamerica should more logically be extended to 1500 [BC], when the transformation from nomadic foraging to a fully sedentary, agricultural way of life was essentially complete throughout the area.' {{harvnb|Pearsall|2008|p=163}} similarly note that '[b]y 2300 [BC] pottery was being manufactured in [Mesoamerica], by which definition marks the end of the Preceramic era and its final Archaic period[; s]ome archaeologists, however, prefer to extend the Archaic to 1500 [BC] or later, by which time agriculture provided the bulk of food and the previously nomadic hunter-gatherers had settled in permanent villages.'}}{{notetag|The term ''Lithic Period'' is sometimes used as a synonym for the ''Preceramic Period'' (eg {{harvnb|Pearsall|2008|p=163}}, eg {{harvnb|Adams|Macleod|2000a|p=46}}), and at other times as a synonym for the ''Palaeoindian Period'' (eg {{harvnb|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=98}}).}}

== Geography ==
During the [[pre-Columbian era]], Belize formed [[Geography of Mesoamerica|part of Mesoamerica]]. Traditionally, the first-order subdivisions of the latter follow cultural or political boundaries of Preclassic, Classic, or Postclassic civilisations, eg [[Maya civilisation|Mayans]] and [[Aztec civilisation|Aztecs]]. The Mayan region of Mesoamerica is one such. It, in turn, is further subdivided physiographically into at least three regions, ie the Lowlands, the Highlands, and the Pacific. Belize lay within the first of these regions, usually termed the Mayan Lowlands.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}
== Climate ==
During the [[Younger Dryas]] stage, as the [[Pleistocene]] progressed to the [[Holocene]] epoch, Belize's climate became increasingly warmer and wetter, its expansive savannah fields increasingly covered by dense [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical broadleaf forests]], and its low-lying coast submerged by a 10 ft (3 m) rise in sea levels.{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|p=420}}{{sfn|Adams|Macleod|2000a|p=47}}{{sfn|Lohse|Borejsza|Joyce|2021|pp=2-4}}{{sfn|Pearsall|2008|pp=163, 173}}{{sfn|Prufer|Alsgaard|Robinson|Meredith|2019|p=2}} It is not certain how exactly the first Palaeoindian settlers adapted to such changes, as little Preceramic plant matter has been recovered in the country and surrounding Mayan Lowlands.{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|p=420}}{{sfn|Lohse|Borejsza|Joyce|2021|p=21}} It has been suggested, however, that the increasing availability of small, freshwater food-sources, eg molluscs, turtles, and aquatic birds, which attended wetter climatic conditions during the early Holocene, may have driven a slow transition away from a diet heavily reliant on large game towards a ''broader-spectrum'' or varied diet incorporating various species of small game and aquatic food-sources.{{sfn|Awe|Ebert|Stemp|Brown|2021|pp=525-526}}

== Demographics ==
Few skeletal findings in [[Belize]] and the broader central Mayan Lowlands have been dated to the Preceramic, resulting in limited understanding of the period's demographics.{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|pp=417-418}}{{sfn|Braswell|2022|p=89}} Remains recovered from caves across the [[Yucatan Peninsula]] have been reliably dated to 13000 BC{{snd}}12000 BC, such findings constituting the earliest available evidence of [[Settlement of the Americas|human presence]] in the Lowlands.{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|p=418}} Genetic studies of Yucatanese remains, and of Lowland remains generally, have tended to confirm demographic models involving multiple migrations from [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] into the Mayan Lowlands.{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|p=418}}{{sfn|Braswell|2022|pp=91-92}} For instance, recent genetic studies on Preceramic skeletal remains from southern Belize found common ancestry between these and Preceramic proto-Chichban speakers from the Panama{{en dash}}Colombia region, indicating that the latter settled in southern Belize during 5500 cal BC{{snd}}3600 cal BC, and intermixed with pre-existing Palaeoindian residents.{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|p=418}}{{sfn|Awe|Ebert|Stemp|Brown|2021|p=524}} Further studies also found common ancestry between this population and modern Mayans, suggesting that later Mayan settlers of Belize intermixed with pre-existing Palaeoindian residents.{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|p=418}}{{sfn|Awe|Ebert|Stemp|Brown|2021|p=524}} Generally, however, Palaeoindians in Belize and the Lowlands are not thought to be direct ancestors of later Mayans, the implication being that the latter ''did not'' intermix with the former upon settlement.{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|p=418}}{{sfn|Braswell|2022|p=92}}{{notetag|{{blockquote|text=What we can take from this [recent genetic studies on Preceramic skeletal remains from southern Belize] is support for the old conclusion that the fluted Clovis and Fishtail [lithic projectile point] traditions of North, Central, and South America were related. Moreover, this technology may have spread as the descendants of one group of early Paleaoindians migrated south through the New World. Among these were the earliest inhabitants of the SBR [Southern Belize Region, in Toledo] dating to the end of the Pleistocene. But these early occupants left an ever-attenuating genetic footprint, either as it was selected against or, much more likely, as later groups arrived. Thus, the much later inhabitants of the SBR and the Maya Area [of Mesoamerica] as a whole may have had some relationship with the Paleoindians of the region 10 millennia earlier, but that relationship probably was quite distant and likely dates to a time before the first Paleoindians left North America and arrived in what today is Belize. Put another way, the genetic evidence that the Maya are direct descendants of the Paleoindians of Central America is very slim and much more strongly suggests that they represent a later migration that, unfortunately, has not yet been dated.|author={{harvnb|Braswell|2022|p=92}}.}}}}

== Technology ==
=== Lithic ===
[[File:Pone.0219812.g002.PNG L.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Preceramic projectile points from Belize {{small|/ A{{en dash}}C Lowe / D{{en dash}}F Sawmill / G Allspice / H Ya'axche / 2019 Prufer ''et al.'' / via PLOS ONE}}]]
[[Lithic technology]] during the first part of the Preceramic is characterised mainly by [[Clovis point|Clovis-style]] ie fluted lanceolate and [[Cueva Fell|Fell's Cave-style]] ie fluted fishtail [[Hand axe|bifaces]].{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|p=418}} Bifaces recovered from Belize and the Mayan Lowlands, however, can seldom be reliably [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]].{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|p=419}}{{sfn|Lohse|Borejsza|Joyce|2021|pp=15-16}} A recent exception to this was provided by excavations in Mayahak Cab Pek and Tzibte Yux, [[Rock shelter|rockshelters]] in southern Belize, which yielded radiocarbon dates of 10450 cal BC{{snd}}10085 cal BC and 8275 cal BC{{snd}}6650 cal BC for one alternately-bevelled biface and three or four possibly Lowe-style stemmed bifaces, respectively.{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|p=419}} The relationship of these radiocarbon-dated bifaces to others recovered in Belize is not clear. In particular, it is thought that Sawmill-, Allspice-, and Ya'axche-style bifaces may predate the aforementioned ones, but this conjecture remains unconfirmed.{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|p=419}}

Bifaces seem to have been phased out in most of Belize and the surrounding Mayan Lowlands by circa 6000 BC, with non-bifacial lithic tools replacing them by circa 3400 BC.{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|pp=419-420}}

In 1983, the Belize Archaic Archaeological Reconnaissance Project (BAAR) proposed a six-phase classification of lithic technology as found in northern Belize.{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|p=417}}{{sfn|Adams|Macleod|2000a|pp=86-87}}{{sfn|Kelly|1993|p=205}} This classification was subsequently criticised and rejected, being described as 'so badly flawed that the resulting chronology has little merit.'{{sfn|Pearsall|2008|p=180}}{{sfn|Kelly|1993|p=205}} An alternative six-phase classification has since been proposed.{{sfn|Kelly|1993|p=205}}{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|loc=supp. 1}}

=== Other ===
Evidence of Preceramic weaving, eg cordage, sandals, baskets, nets, and bags, has been recovered across Mesoamerica, though not in Belize.{{sfn|Awe|Ebert|Stemp|Brown|2021|p=528}} It has been suggested that their absence in the country is rather due to poor preservation of organic material, rather than due to a lack of weaving by Palaeoindian settlers.{{sfn|Awe|Ebert|Stemp|Brown|2021|p=528}}

== Subsistence ==
The diet of the first Palaeoindian settlers has not been fully elucidated. Faunal remains from Actun Halal in southern Belize suggest these early settlers consumed [[Pachychilus|jute snails]], horses, [[Peccary|peccaries]], [[common agouti]], and [[spectacled bear|spectacled bears]].{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|pp=420-421}} Floral and faunal evidence from the El Gigante rockshelter in Honduras suggests their diet included [[Spondias mombin|hog plums]], [[Avocado|pears]]&lt;!-- ''avocados'' called pears in Belize--&gt;, [[Pouteria sapota|mammee apples]]&lt;!-- ''Mamey'' called mammee or mammee apple in Belize--&gt;, [[Mesquite|mesquite beans]], acorns, deer, birds, turtles, crabs, and snails.{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|pp=420-421}} Similar evidence from the Santa Marta rockshelter in Chiapas suggests the likely consumption of green tomatoes, [[Byrsonima crassifolia|craboo]]&lt;!-- ''nance'' in Spanish, 'craboo' in Belize--&gt;, figs,  deer, peccary, rabbits, snakes, iguanas, tortoises, and jute snails, and the possible consumption of cacao and [[teosinte]].{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|pp=420-421}}

The early settlers are thought to [[Neolithic Revolution|have begun farming]] by circa 4500 BC, with the practice becoming increasingly common by circa 3400 BC.{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|p=421}} Floral remains from northern and central Belize suggest maize, [[cassava]], chilis, squash, and beans were the main cultivars, these being increasingly relied upon for nutrition during 3000 BC{{snd}}1500 BC.{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|p=421}} This increasing reliance on farmed produce is thought to have resulted in forest disturbance, deforestation, and landscape modification.{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|p=421}}{{notetag|However, carbon and nitrogen isotopes in bone collagen and bone apatite from human skeletal remains from southern Belize indicate that the diet in this area did not include maize prior to circa 2750 cal BC ({{harvnb|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|p=421}}, {{harvnb|Braswell|2022|p=92}}). Additionally, faunal remains from northern Belize indicate that a wide array of game were still being hunted during 3400 BC{{snd}}900 BC, including common agouti, armadillo, snakes, turtles, freshwater fish and molluscs, and possibly [[white-tailed deer]] {{harv|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|pp=421-422}}.}}

== Sites ==
{{Preceramic Belize sites location map}}
Preceramic artefacts have been recovered mainly from northern and central Belize.{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|p=417}} Preceramic findings in southern Belize 'had been suspiciously absent' since the 1980s, being limited to a few surface finds until quite recently.{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|p=417}}{{sfn|Awe|Ebert|Stemp|Brown|p=527}} Generally, few Preceramic living spaces have been identified in the Mayan Lowlands.{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|p=422}} Seven Preceramic sites in Belize have been recently proposed as such, ie Saki Tzul, Mayahak Cab Pek, Tzibte Yux, Actun Halal, Caye Coco, Ladyville, and Xunantunich.{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|p=422}}{{sfn|Awe|Ebert|Stemp|Brown|2021|p=526}} An additional four have been recently proposed as ''working'' spaces, eg as lithic workshops, namely, Colha, Kelly, Ladyville, and Callar Creek.{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|p=422}}

== Scholarship ==
The earliest work on Preceramic artefacts from Belize is thought to be that of [[Augustus Pitt Rivers]], who exhibited a flint implement for the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] on 2 March 1871, which had been recovered from the country 'some years ago' by a [[Royal Navy]] officer.{{sfn|Fox|1871|p=93}}{{sfn|Pendergast|1993|p=4}}{{sfn|Franks|1877|p=38}} The discovery, however, did not spark much interest, as work in the region focussed on Classic Period sites and artefacts.{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|pp=416-417}}{{sfn|Adams|Macleod|2000a|p=26}}

The first significant work was that of the Belize Archaic Archaeological Reconnaissance Project (BAAR), begun in 1980.{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|pp=416-417}}{{sfn|Adams|Macleod|2000a|p=86}}{{sfn|Pearsall|2008|p=180}} BAAR identified some 150 possibly Preceramic sites across the country, and conducted excavations in nine of these, all in northern Belize.{{sfn|Stemp|Awe|Marcus|Helmke|2021|p=417}}{{sfn|Pearsall|2008|p=180}}{{sfn|Kelly|1993|p=205}}
