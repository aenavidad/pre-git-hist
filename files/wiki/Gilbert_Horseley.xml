'''Gilbert Horseley''' ({{floruit|1574{{nbnd}}1575}}) was an [[Sea Dogs|Elizabethan privateer]] who lead raids in [[Nuevo Cartago y Costa Rica Province|Veragua]] and [[History of Honduras#Colonial Honduras|colonial Honduras]].

== Career ==
===Departure===
Sylvester, a French corsair, is thought to have cleared from [[Port of Le Havre|Havre]] in September 1574, aboard a ship 'carrying a hundred fighting men.' They set upon [[Nuevo Cartago y Costa Rica Province|Veragua]] that December, where it is thought that African slaves informed them of Spanish merchant-ships off the northern coast of the province. Consequently, in the first quarter of 1575, 'the said corsairs [...] divided their forces [...] endeavouring to join with the ''cimarrones'' [and so went] to the Desaguadero ([[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|San Juan River]]) [...] to take the frigates come from there [...].'{{sfn|Wright|1932|pp=xlvi-xlvii}}

Horseley is thought to have cleared from Plymouth in November 1574, with a crew of 25, aboard the ''John'', a 25-tonne pinnace, and to have come upon Sylvester just before that captain's northward journey to Desaguadero.{{sfn|Wright|1932|pp=xlvii, 98}}{{sfn|Bradley|1999|p=9|loc=footnote no. 6}}{{sfn|Bradley|1999|p=75}}{{sfn|Williamson|1938|pp=129-130}}{{notetag|Horseley's ''[[zabra]]'' would later be described as 'a fast vessel [of] medium size [...] with 22 ''harquebuses'', and seven pieces of artillery, large and small; an immense supply of arrows, much war material, and all in very good order' {{harv|Wright|1932|p=98|loc=footnotes nos. 4, 7}}.}}{{notetag|Eight of Horseley's men died while the ''John'' engaged a 50-tonne Spanish vessel off the Barbary coast {{harv|Bradley|1999|pp=75–76}}.}}

===Expedition===
====Southern leg ====
Upon arriving at Veragua, the English crew (like the French) 'got into touch with the "Sem Rownes."{{hairspace}}' Now in consort, and with a Portuguese pilot (Luis Marquês), Horseley and Sylvester ascended the San Juan River, intending to sack [[Granada, Nicaragua|Granada]]. Before reaching said city, however, the crew came upon certain Spanish frigates, in which ''[[vecinos]]'' from [[Olancho Department|Olancho]] were transporting African slaves to Veragua. This treasure having satisfied both parties, Horseley and Sylvester desisted from their enterprise and returned to open sea.{{sfn|Wright|1932|p=xlvii, 96}}{{sfn|Bradley|1999|p=76}}{{sfn|Marley|1998|pp=104}}{{notetag|The ''vecinos'' and slaves made their escape, ostensibly unharmed {{harv|Wright|1932|p=96}}.}}

Their treasure secured in the Desaguadero, Horseley and Sylvester sailed back to Veragua, where 'acts of exceptional and cowardly cruelty were committed.' The crews are thought to have killed 'many people, cutting their throats,' and to further have 'committed great robberies and insults.' Thereafter, the parties parted ways, with Horseley sailing back to the Bay of Honduras.{{sfn|Wright|1932|pp=xlviii, 99}}

====Northern leg ====
[[File:A view of Truxillo, a city belonging to the Spaniards in the Bay of Honduras LCCN2003666724.png|thumb|upright=1.3|''A view of Truxillo Bay and city on the coast of Honduras'' {{small|/ 1796 lithograph by Thomas Bowen / via LC}}]]
Horseley entered the Bay of Honduras on 2 April 1575, making landfall at Cape Honduras (near [[Puerto Castilla, Honduras|Puerto Castilla]] under cover of night. At the break of midnight, the crew, packed into a [[Launch (boat)|launch]], surreptitiously stole towards [[Trujillo, Honduras|Trujillo]] (three ''[[Spanish customary units|leguas]]'' distant), but were immediately sighted by a keen-eyed sentinel at the [[Santa Bárbara fortress|Fortress of Santa Barbara]]. The city's military and ''vecinos'' rushed to organise a defence, which proved formidable enough to convince Horseley to desist. The crew were fired upon by the Fort, to ensure their retreat, but this did was not sufficient to stop Horseley from seizing a Spanish frigate at port.{{sfn|Wright|1932|p=97}}{{sfn|Marley|1998|pp=104}}

At the break of day, on 3 April 1575, Fort sentinels spotted Horseley (now in their frigate) making for [[Puerto Cortés|Puerto Caballos]], likely 'to pillage the port and the ships which were there.' A warning shallop was forthwith despatched from the Fort, but being spotted by the English, was seized some 20 leagues into its trip (off present-day [[Atlántida Department|Atlantida]]). That afternoon, Horseley seized another Spanish prize (Juan Antonio owner), laden with treasure worth over 3,000 [[Spanish escudo|ducats]]. These latter are thought to have been cruelly treated, being tortured by Horseley's crew for gold and sailing directions.{{sfn|Wright|1932|pp=97-98}}{{notetag|The Fort's messenger to Puerto Caballos was dealt 'two arrow-wounds' upon his shallops seizure.  {{harv|Wright|1932|p=98}}.}}{{notetag|Spanish prisoners later reported that Horseley 'charted the whole of this [Honduras] coast from Point Manavique to Golfo Dulce [...]' {{harv|Wright|1932|p=98|loc=footnote no. 7}}. The escapees further reported that Horseley had been piloted by a Portuguese sailor, 'a man not known here [Trujillo]' {{harv|Wright|1932|p=98}}.}}

This accomplished, Hershey continued towards Puerto Caballos (aboard his ship and the launch). Upon reaching El Triunfo de la Cruz, they met two Spanish merchant-ships (Martín Monte and Vicencio Garullo captains). These the English attempted to board, but were heavily bombarded with artillery, the merchants forcing the former to desist.

Horseley now made for [[Cabo Camarón (Honduras)|Cape Camaron]] (20 leagues due east of Trujillo), reaching it the night of 5 April 1575. The crew watered at this cape, during which time two of their Spanish prisoners made their escape. They reported that Horseley had warned he 'would return another year with a greater force.'{{sfn|Wright|1932|p=99}}{{sfn|Marley|1998|pp=104}}

===Return===
Horseley 'now passably rich [...] arrived at Plymouth with fifteen of this men in June 1575,' from where he immediately continued to [[Arundel]] to unload his treasure 'without causing unwelcome interest.'{{sfn|Wright|1932|p=xlviii}}{{sfn|Bradley|1999|p=76}}{{sfn|Williamson|1938|pp=131}}{{notetag|Horseley reached Veragua with 17 men {{harv|Bradley|1999|p=76}}. However, Honduran prisoners, who had been detained by Horseley from 3{{nbnd}}5 April, reported that his crew numbered 32 {{harv|Wright|1932|p=98|loc=footnote no. 7}}.}}

==Aftermath==
Diego López reported the degradation to the Spanish Crown, writing{{nbnd}}
{{block quote
|text=This city has felt these robberies keenly, and is cast down because it lacked means to offend any enemy. [...] since your majesty has ordered me to serve in this port and to guard and defend it, I humbly entreat your majesty to order me to be provided with the means, and forces for the task [...] This miserable city [...] so afflicted, and frequently attacked by enemies, is now without resources, and what is accomplished, is done by main strength [...].
|author=Truxillo, 20 May 1575, López to Crown, trans. Wright.{{sfn|Wright|1932|p=99}}
}}
The Crown thanked López for his service, and gave instructions to the presiding officer of the [[Real Audiencia of Guatemala]] 'concerning money,' and to authorities at [[Seville]] 'concerning artillery' for Trujillo's defence.{{sfn|Wright|1932|p=99}}

== Legacy ==
Horseley and Sylvester's ascent of the San Juan River has been described as 'daring' and 'comparable to Drake's most daring exploits,' given that said river, 'unlike the sea, kept no safe retreat upen for [the captains],' and that the expedition was completed with a small crew and pinnace.{{sfn|Wright|1932|p=xlvii}}{{sfn|Bradley|1999|p=79}}
