		Partitions of data which may be of use to us here		"NOTA we want classifications which are binary ie set partitioned into y and not y, which are easily mechanically computable or decidable ie not much thinking to classify a thing, and which produce gradually smaller classes of objects as levels increase ie level n class properly larger than level n+1 class AN 21 JUL 2022 / NOTA classes may need revision given last desideratum for decreasing class sizes AN 21 JUL 2022"
