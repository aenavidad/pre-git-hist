AGI 141-1-16, The Council for War Affairs in the Indies to His Majesty, May 16, 1638). In May of the year 1638, El Mulato asked forgiveness from the Spanish Crown, which was soon granted. But he did not appear in Havana, where he had offered to go; and in 1641 he was robbing and murdering in the name of the Prince of Orange. Cf. AGI 54-1-17, Riaño at the Crown, Havana, November 13, 1638; 147-5-22 The Council for War Affairs in the Indies to His Majesty, March 4, 1639; 78-2-3, Vol. 10, f. 131r, and f. 133, cédulas to Diego Martin, 15 March 1639; to Riaño of the same date; f. 183, cédula to the governor of Margarita, Saragossa, August 5, 1645, in which he is warned that Dieguillo was plotting with the Duke of Braganza for the purpose of taking possession of the island for Portugal; 54-2-11, 16 September 1639, Riaño hands over to his successor cédulas concerning Diego Martin; 54-1-18, 1 September 1641, Diego el Mulato takes possession of an advisory boat from Cartagena at the height of Havana, with a considerable loss of human life on the part of the Spaniards, to whom he orders to ""fly the flag for the Prince of Orange”. /Wright/van Dam, v 1, 297"

Only six villages of some 150 families ... remained loyal to the [Sp] crown; but of these some had fled to the forests ""either out of fear that they would be carried off by the rebels or for not being able to tolerate the weight of the work, being so few."" /via Jones 1 p210 /xxx [Bishop of Yucatán to Crown, 5 mar 1643]

All of these events [eg massacres at Tah Itza in 1623, at Sacalum in 1624], ... were the prelude ot the dramatic collapse of Spanish control over most of the Maya towns of the Bacalar province beginning in 1638, the opening year of Katun 1 Ahau. This loss of colonial control was by 1642 replaced by a regenerated Maya leadership based at Tipu. /Jones 1 p190

Complicating our understanding of the period [1638–42] are the poorly understood effects of increasing depredations of foreign pirates along the eastern coasts [of Bacalar province], which ceertainly would have stimulated coastal Mayas to seek refuge in interior locations around Tipu. These depredations, in combination with independence movements at Tipu, had devastating implications for the villa of Bacalar, which was already in a weakened state due to its administration by an absentee leadership based at Valladolid. /Jones 1 p191

These [Sp, mulattos and mestizos of Bacalar], he [Gov of Yuc] said, numbered only about 50 and were a miserable, poor lot, living by going from village to vilage selling things which they bartered for the locally produced cacao. In so doing, he claimed, they extorted the Indians. /Jones 1 p205 /MEXICO,360 [10 jul 1638] / on extortion see eg MEXICO,369 ff 537r–539 /v Barke 12 61

[80 Ma from Manan and Chinam] have declared that by deceits and threats from the Indians of Tipu, by messages they had sent them that they were to give obedience to their king and wished them to abandon their town [Manan], saying that if they did not do so all would die and be finished, because at such a time the Itzas would come to kill them and there would be great mortalities and hurricanes that would flood the land. /via Jones 1 p207 /xxx [20 sep 1638] / Holpatin likewise received these reports from Tipu, per Bacalar intelligence /via Jones 1 p208

Here they built a great many Houses and Hutts, and employ'd Multitudes of Negroes in cutting Logwood, which was transported to Jamaica and Europe by Numbers of Vessels trading from thence to the Bay ... /RWJBG 375

Few communities endure so many difficulties as the settlers in he above-mentioned Bay; but as if their situation was directly the revese, and claimed chastisement lest they should be too happy, it pleases their kind Governors in England, to deprive them of any one moment's safety or satisfaction, by continually deluging them wiht torrents of convicts of the most unprincipled kind. Several of the smaller settlers have lately been absolutely ruined by the robberies effected int heir property, by these desperadoes, who find immediate reception either at Bacalar or Truxillo: This reception is the more remarkable, those English criminals not being found to exhibit an improved state of morals; since for the commission of various crimes, upwards of twenty of those people were in confinement at the town of Bacalar, when the last advices were received—Roused at lenght, and irritated beyond bearance, the Magistrates and people in general, as we are informed, resolved, at a late general meeting, ""To oppose the admission of any more of these pests and outcasts; to admonish such commanders as may convey them there, to depart without debarking any of them; and, in case he should obstinately persist, to set the vessel or vessels on fire.” /NYP 574

Como este aviso incluía las circunstancias de que yo tomase las medidas convenientes sobre el particular, respecto a que los tenía declarados fuera de la protección del Rey de la Gran Bretaña, regulé por más adecuado a la delicadeza del asunto y a no empeñar algún lancecillo que ocasionase disgustos en el tiempo más crítico de estarse cumpliendo la evacuación del territorio de Mosquitos, y por otra parte no manifestar una debilidad repugnante a los mismos derechos de la soberanía española, no obstante de ser el citado paraje uno de los comprendidos en la demarcación de los ampliados, dispuse que ... pasase el Captián de los Reales Ejércitos, con sueldo de vivo y efectivo, D.

Salió este oficial el día 2 de este mas para el Walis, y habiéndose puesto de buena fe con el Superinendente inglés, logró en los días 4, 5 y 6 del mismo, con la mayor felicidad, la transmigración de los referidos colonos a la parte del norte que les es permitida, persuadiéndoles a ella con todo de su repugnancia, con moderación, prudencia, y humanidad; y para precaver que volviesen a ocupar éstos, u otros nuevos, las casas ... previno al Cadete del Batallón de Castilla D.

Ricardo Hoar, no obstante las reconvenciones prudentes que al efecto le hizo a vista de las casas, muebles y ocupaciones en que se empleaba de aserrar maderas, al pretexto de suponerse se hallaba en pesquería, usando en su contestación de un modo nada conforme al espíritu que debe existir, al ejemplo del cordialidad y buena fe establecido entre las dos Cortes de Madrid y Londres. Este incidente, y el no aventurar ningún lance ajeno de las circunstancias que más interesan en el día, me obligó a dirigir mi recurso al Coronel D. E. M.

En consideración a que ya le tenía entregado al Sup Despard, desde el día 18 de Julio la parte meridional del Walis, haste el número de leguas descubiertas en el Sibún, en el entretanto emprendíamos el reconocimiento y averiguación de su origen, me pareció oportuno, no obstante a que no dejé de explicarme con el referido Superintendente, el disimular prudente aquellos excesos, pero por lo respectivo a los que no podían mirarse con esa indiferencia, tomé sobre mi el cuidado de ir intimidando a los ingleses situados en aquellos establecimientos a que se desalojasen de ellos, pues a mi regreso (como lo ejecuté) había de destruirlos, y en muchos ranchos en donde no encontré persona alguno, por haberlos desamparado enterados de que subía, los quemé con su [Despard?] acuerdo, después de haber examinado personal y unidamente los montes, en que patenticé el gran número de piezas trozadas en aquellos parajes, y destiné al Capt Rafael Breson, para que con el mismo Despard, siguiese la propia diligencia, desde el Real de demarcación hasta el brazo del oeste. En el intermedio de nuestras operaciones, no sólo se desalojaron, pero precipitadamente arrojaron al agua, y condujeron a la boca, considerable número de las tozas de caoba que tenían cortadas, y ví a mi subida: las cuales llegaban a más de 1000, y por esta razón, me fué imposible el marcarlas con la del Rey a mi vuelta, y sólo lo pude hacer de una corta porción de ellas, y otras que se quemaron, por ser poco útiles, y para que sirviera de ejemplo a la pena del contrabando; protestando a V. E. que el enunciado Despard, me manifestó que sin reflexión a su autoridad ni a sus reconvenciones, llegaba este desorden hasta tocar en hacer ventas con sintrumentos públicos de los terrenos españoles, y formar pleitos contenciosos, entre si el derecho que unos suponían a la madera que cortaban, aventurando a sus negros, y demás gastos si los aprendían los españoles, y otros alegando propiedad sobre el terreno en que lo verificaban ... /v Calderon 322 /MEXICO,3023"

The giving HM sanction and authority to the destruction of the Plantations by the Spanish Commissary was ""an act highly exceptionable."" Gual should have reported finding them to his superiors, as their status was doubtful and Spain has since given her consent to such cultivation. Similarly Gual should have been permitted to report the finding of the system of Magistrates to his superiors. Despard knew that the introduciton of a Plan of Police was under consideration in England. Even if Gual had been right in making the complaint and Despard had been authorised to abolish the Courts it would have been wrong to do so since the Settlement could not subsist without them and he himself proceeded to set up an alternative system ""equally liable to the objection by which you declared the former to be illegal."" /via Burdon 1 p180 /CO 123/8

De éstos y de la cantidad de caoba extraída, no hubiera yo podido instruirme con toda exactitud, si no me hubiera auxiliado a ellos las noticias de habitantes fidedignos, las cuales no me fué difícil adquirir, porque el común de los habitantes detesta semejantes infracciones, y anhela el verlas remediadas, por lo que le dañan, haciendo descender el precio de la caoba con la excesiva abundancia a la mitad de lo que generalmente se considera necesario para que la corta sea útil a los cortadores. ... Los más de los pescadores de los establecimientos; hacen la pesca, especialmente la de la tortuga fuera de límites; entre los cayos que están al sur de los mismos establecimientos, y uno, y otro he oído que van a las islas inmediatas al Cabo Catoche ... No hay, como he dicho, en los establecimientos, obra alguno de defensa, ni el menos preparativo militar, pues de dos casas fuertes, que cuando yo salí para la visita, aún se dudaba si existían en la Boca de Jalova, no había en ésta ni señales de donde estuvieron, pero me hallo bien enterado de que el Oficial a quien se comisionó, para examinar el estado de las costas durante los últimos recelos de rompimiento, no padeció ni la más level equivocación en cuanto informó tocante a obras, a ejercicios militares, que quiso desfigurar el Sup Hunter; ... hay 9 Magistrados, de que bastan 3 para formar un cuerpo; transan las desavenencias civiles que ocurren entre los habitantes, y juzgan los delitos cometidos dentro de los límites, con autoridad de condenar a muerte, y hacer ejecutar la pena, fundando sus sentencias sobre las leyes generales de Inglaterra. Su oficio es anual, y se eligen los nuevos a principios de Mayo. Hay también otro cuerpo político que se titula el Gran Jury, y se compone de 12 habitantes juramentados cuya obligación es representar a los Magistrados en Juntas Generales, que se celebran cada 3 meses, todo lo que es necesario a favor del común. Así me explicó un Magistrado, persona de talento y verdad, dicho sistema. No hay Superintendente, ni esperan que la haya; .. /v Calderon 389 /MEXICO,3025"

It is not then astonishing, that, although the same undeviating contempt has continued to the last day to be exercised towards the Civil Authority by Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton (as appears by sufficient documents) a set of men could be found to address him on this departure, expressing the cause of that address to be on Account ""ofo the readiness he evinced in Support of the Civil Authority of this Settlemetn""—never did the Annals of any Country (boasting reservedly of the freedom of our glorious constitution) furnish such an example of weakness and inconsistency as to contradict in Specific terms, the clearest facts, sanctioned by the Strongest Documents, and a general vote of the Community. After what has been transmitted to our Agent for the inspection of [Home] Government, what must His Majesty's Ministers think of the Bay of Honduras or will they ever respect or representations, Complaints or Memorials; and if some counterpoise is not immediately administered, is not he truth, Honor, respectability and Interest of this Settlement indelibly Stained and injured, by such an Egregious act of tergiversation.""

The Church, which has been erected at so great an expence, cannot be rendered useful to the Public—The Jail has fallen into such decay that the most notorious Offender may make his escape at pleasure—and a Debt has been contracted to the Amount of nearly 10,000 Pounds, which in honour the Public is bound to liquidate—with all these circumstances before you opposition is made to every means of raising Money, ...

The free people of Colour enjoy the Elective Franchise, but in order to qualify them they must possess double the property of a White Elector. A White Elector must swear that he is worth £100; a Brown Elector £200. The Legislative [Pub] Meeting. The Assembly consists of 40, and free people of Colour are qualified to serve as Members; at the present time the Assembly consists of 28 Whites, and 12 free persons of Colour. A White person possessed of £250, a Brown of £500, British Subjects become Members without election by entering themselves and taking hte oath of allegiance. Offices of Honor and Trust. Magistrates and Jurors. From these the free people of Colour are wholly excluded. Militia. Free persons of Colour are not allowed to hold Commission during the War with Spain, and when the Colony was actually attacked they did hold Commssions, but upon a recent organization of that Corps they have been excluded. Court of Justice. The Supreme Criminal Court consists of Commissioners appointed by the King's commission under the 59 Geo: 3. They are in number 4 or more. The Civil Court consists of 7 Magistrates who are elected by the Inhabitants—and for them the free people vote: but no person of Colour has hitherto been nominated by the King's Commission to be a Judge of the Criminal Court, and they are considered to be disqualified to be elected Members of the Civil Court. ... For this exclusion from the Magistracy etc. there is no positive Law; it rests upon custom only. Honduras is essentially distinguished form Jamaica and the West India Islands in very important particulars. Nearly two thirds of the whole property at Honduras in Land, Slaves, and personalty belong to the free coloured class exclusive of the free blacks; they enjoy as I have already observed privileges unkown to their brethren in our other Colonies. And there is also this remarkable difference that at the Honduras all classes white and brown mix in society, where-as in Jamaica the brown race are wholly excluded. ... /v Burdon 3 298 /R 5B

The papers contain more news than we generally receive fm that little out of the way corner of the world. First, we have accounts of a bloodless civil revolution in Belize. About the last of May it was rumored that the members of the Exec Cl had all sent in their resignations, in consequence of orders fm England that the Council was to be abolished; but these orders were accompanied by offers of seats on the bench of magistrates tot he members, with continuance of their honorary titles and of exemption fm jury and militia duty. All but two however, rejected these offers with noble indignation. But, to the astonishment of every body, in a day or two it was officially announced that the magistrates had been sworn in as members of the Council; so the upshot of it seems to be that the Council was not abolished, but only reorganized by the creation of a new set of Councillors. ... /North American [PA] VI 1642 p2 = 8 Jul 1844"

BELIZE, HON, March 5, 1856. A citizen of New York, a few months since, came through that place [Guat] on his way home fm California. There he fell sick, and while in that state his money—about 500 dollars—was taken fm him for safe keeping and he could not get it back when he got well. He was obliged to sell his watch and clothing to get here, where he arrived nearly a skeleton, fm exposure and want, without clothing or money, and no one to apply to for assistance. In this state he came to me and explained his situation, at the same time saying, ""this is the only place I ever was in where I could get no employment, and must either beg or steal."" This is not a solitary case; for the last seven years a great number of Americans have travelled through this town, nearly three-quarters of whom have been in a destitute condition; and as there is no government agent here they are forced to suffer. Many have sunk under it, and now rest among the dead in our burial ground. This ought not to be. Your govt should have some agent to assist your citizens when, by accident, they are destitute in foreign countries. Many or our poor ""Jacks,"" when they get here, represent themselves as English sailors, for they soon learn that there is provision made for English sailors who are destitute; that is, they are allowed one shilling sterling per day, and then they get a free passage in the Royal Mail Steamship Co. steamer to Jamaica or St. Thomas. /Weekly Herald NY XX 15 p118 = 12 Apr 1856"

BELIZE, Hon, Dec 29, 1857. A new election for members of Assembly has just been held. The men known as opposed to the govt all received the highest votes—while the men called government men received much less. Samuel Squire Pluses, the police magistrate, a fresh Jamaica man, received only eight votes; and, if he can take it, he now has a hint of his popularity among the respectable portion of our community, for all the voters in this county are property holders, and have to possess property qualifications. ... On the adoption of the new constitution in 1852, a new Sup Ct was formed; lately a new code of practice, rules and process. These were drawn up by the AG, remodelled and amended by the Assembly, and now work very badly; in fact, they don't work at all. Right cannot be had nor justice done, unless you have the money to pay and are fortunate enough to secure the services of the AG, when you are sure to succeed. This is a bad state of things, and cannot well be altered until honest lawyers can be imported, which, I fear, is far distant, judging fm those we have had heretofore. /New York Herald Morn Ed 7809 p1 = 19 Jan 1858"
