As to the State of the Bay of Honduras, I shall give it you as briefly as possible. The ancient City of Bacalar, situate in that Part of the Province of Yucatan, which lies on the Bay of Honduras, was twice sack'd, and at last totally ruined by the English many Years ago; on which the Logwood-Cutters of that nation, who had settled on the River of Valis, possessed themselves of the new River and that of Hondo; which last is distant form the Ruins of Bacalar about five Leagues. Here they built a great many Houses and Hutts, and employ'd Multitudes of Negroes in cutting Logwood, which was transported to Jamaica and Europe by Numbers of Vessels trading form thence to the Bay. But our present [Sp] Governor, who is a Field-Marshal, and an old Officer, having resolv'd to rebuild and fortify Bacalar, after it had lain in Ruins for a long time, thereby to hinder the English from cutting Wood in those Parts, went thither in Person, and accomplished his Design; And thereafer with the Forces he carried with him from Campeche, and other he drew together from the Lake of Bacalar, he attacked the New Settlements of the English on these two last mentioned Rivers, burnt their Habitations, seiz'd all their Instruments for cutting Wood, and other Craft for carrying on their Trade, and the Year following served their Settlement on the River of Valis n the same Manner: So that in the Space of two Years, it is computed, he has taken about 140 Vessels of one sort or other, burnt upwards of 300,000 Quintals of Logwood, ready cut and piled upon the Shore, and made a great many of the English and their Negroes Prisoners. Upon this such as had escaped into the Woods came to this Resolution: They wrote to the Governor in June last, acquainting his Excellency, that they were wiling to abandon these Places and begg'd of him that he would allow them Time to transport themselves tot he Colonies of Great Britain; which he agreed to, and gave them to the last Day of January next for that Purpose: And this Agreement they have so far fulfilled, that at present by th east Accounts there scarce now remains in all those Parts 30 Persons, and these under such Hardships, that they wish for nothing more, than an Opportunity to be gone. This is the present Condition of the Bay of Honduras, which in all probability must continue, our Governor being resolved to protect the Trade, and defend the Possessions, which his Catholick Majesty has been pleased to commit to his Care and Government. /RWJBG 375"

This interruption was followed by the expulsion of the settlers from those points of the coast which were considered as beyond the limits assigned in the recent treaty [of Paris 1763]. They were commanded to retire from Rio Hondo within the space of two months; they were confined to the south bank of Rio Nuevo; and both at Rio Nuevo and Rio Wallis, they were restricted from ascending to the distance of more than twenty leagues from the sea. By these aggressions, more than five hundred settlers were driven from their habitations, with the loss of their property, amounting to above £27,000 sterling. /v Coxe v 4 316 /Lord Auckland's Collections [MS.
