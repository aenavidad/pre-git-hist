[the Attorney General's] opinion was as follows: That the Civil Power in Honduras is not competent to try offences extending to life or limb: That any infringements on the Regulations since Col. Hunter's Proclamation not sanctioned by proper authority are illegal: That the Transient tax should be expended on the Service of the Settlement, but that duties on Wine, Spirits &c. should go to the [Home] Government: That as it is undetermined whether the Settlement is ""a part of HM Dominions or not"", a certain part of wrecked goods might be claimed by the Superintendent for [Home] Government, but that such action was not worth while: That the entrance and clearing of Ships should properly belong to the Sec of the Superintendent, but, whether to him or to the Clerk of the Court, the appointment should be at the disposal of the Superintendent: That the Rules and Regulations under Col Hunter's Proclamation ""were perfectly adapted to the local situation”: and that the Superintendent had acted rightly in suppressing the Police Magistracy, unless there were some authority among the [Public] Records of which he [AG] was unaware. /Burdon 2 p45"

1801, Sep 7. ADVERTISEMENT. Notice To The Public. WHEREAS it appears that a few evil minded Persons either from Pique or malice are willing to lead the Public astray and draw them from their proper allegiance to HM Government, the Superintendent requests that the People will individually weigh what follows and treat it with coolness and candour. The present Contest between the Superintendent and Magistrates is not whether there should or should not be Public meetings but whether they should be with or without his approbation and that such meeting should be enabled to form Laws that should be binding to the Settlement without either his approbation or concurrence. He appeals to the Public whether any Gentleman would accept of the situations of Superintendent and Commanding in Chief of the Settlement situated as this is, surrounded by enemies and responsible for the safety of it to HM and the Gov of Jam and allow the Sovreignty of it to be wrested from him and usurped which in this case it must be by a Set of People very inadequate to the task. ... /via Burdon 2 /ML B

The intention of calling such meeting was formerly communicated in writing to HM Sup through the medium of Captain Luson and Advertisements were accordingly put up, calling a meeting of the Inhabitants on the 18th intant solely for the purpose aforesaid which have since taken down by his authority. The Magistates disclaim any idea of offering the least opposition to HM Sup Comm in Chief in the due execution of his Authority or of usurping powers not legally vested in them, and they request their Constituents to continue that peaceable and loyal demeanour they have ever held. ...

It is not long since (as appears by the Records of this Settlement) that this Body in a becoming, manly and spirited manner withstood an attack upon the dearest rights of British Subjects, made by a Military Force in direct opposition to Civil Authority, the people roused to a proper sense of their duty, unanimously came forward in Support of those Magistrates (who in the proper exercise of their Functions protected their Constituents) and pledged themselves individually and collectively to the utmost of their power, to support the Magistrates in their just endeavours to prevent the evils resulting form a tame submission to Military encroachment; in this very Court House did they cheerfully and unanimously place their Signatures to these laudable Resolves. It is not then astonishing, that, although the same undeviating contempt has continued to the last day to be exercised towards the Civil Authority by Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton (as appears by sufficient documents) a set of men could be found to address him on this departure, expressing the cause of that address to be on Account ""ofo the readiness he evinced in Support of the Civil Authority of this Settlemetn""—never did the Annals of any Country (boasting reservedly of the freedom of our glorious constitution) furnish such an example of weakness and inconsistency as to contradict in Specific terms, the clearest facts, sanctioned by the Strongest Documents, and a general vote of the Community. After what has been transmitted to our Agent for the inspection of [Home] Government, what must His Majesty's Ministers think of the Bay of Honduras or will they ever respect or representations, Complaints or Memorials; and if some counterpoise is not immediately administered, is not he truth, Honor, respectability and Interest of this Settlement indelibly Stained and injured, by such an Egregious act of tergiversation.""

Gual a [Col John Nugent] Smyth, Bacalar a 28 febrero 1812. De mi oficio de 25 del corriente [feb 1812] habrá V.S. inferido la sorpresa que recibiria al primer parte que se me dió de haberse presentado en la boca del Rio Nuevo dos buques armados, cuyo cmoandante, de órden de V.S., hizo retirar el pequeño destacamento que habia yo mandado á aquel puerto de mi jurisdiccion, y desde luego creí que algun equivocado informe habria sido la causa; pero mas me ha sorprendido vern en el oficio de V.S. del 22 (que me entregó ayer D. Juan Coatguelwin, capitan commandante de artillería) que considera el Rio Nuevo no comprendido en el distrito de este gobierno.—Con fecha 17 de Julio 1810 exigí de V.S. que dictara providencias para que ningun habitante de ese establecimiento volviera á entrar por las puntas de Piedra y Calentura á poner cortes de madera á otros trabajos de la parte de acá; y su contestacion, léjos de oponerse á esta circunstancia ni mirarla como nueva ó injusta, fué la de que iba á dar cuenta á los ministros de S.M.B. con mi oficio, y que entretanto permanecerian las cosas en el estado en que se hallaban. Ni los capitanes generales de Yucatan, ni los gobernadores de Bacalar desde que una declaracion de guerra abolió el tratado de paz de 1783 y convencion de 86, han creido que los súbditos británicos pudieran extenderse hasta dentro de dichas puntas: y la correspondencia que medió entre la capitanía general y esa superintendencia, despues del tratado de paz de Amiens, fué extendida en este concepto; sin que á él se oponga el que algunos con precaucion para no ser vistos de la vigía de San Antonio, hayan venido á dicho Rio Nuevo; y tengo una reciente prueba de que ellos mismos han graduado de ilícita su conducta, y es la de que el Sr. Wade, en papel que envió para mí con fecha 2 del corriente, no expresó el lugar donde estaba ni el cabo destacado en dicho vigía: por mas que preguntó á los conductores de dónde venian, consiguió descubrir la verdad, pues le dijeron que del Walix, hallándose Wade en la laguna del Tipú, ... /v Peniche 383 /xxx

Gual a Smyth, Bacalar a 7 agosto 1812. Me dijo V.S. en su oficio de 22 de Febrero [1812], y con mas extension en el de 4 de Marzo, que los cortadores de madera habian estado cortándola en Rio Nuevo durante la guerra y siempre despues de ella. En este presidio todo el tiempo de la guerra hubo lo ménos triplicado número de tropas que en ese establecimiento, una lancha con un cañon de á 24, un ponton con uno de á 18, todas las piraguas armadas, y se hacian preparativos para una expedicion con fuerzas navales que debian venir de Campeche, y continuamente una piragua bien guarnecida y con artillería de guarda-costa, cruzando hasta mas de las puntas de Piedra y Calentura, y la misma subia por Rio Nuevo á la laguna del Tipú para reconocer sus crillas y particularmente el istmo que media entre el extremo de esta y el estero español ó *Spanish Creek*, habiendo sido el capitan D. .Manuel Melendez quien practicó esta diligencia al concluirse la guerra: de aquí inferirá V.S. que ningun cortador habia de incurrir en la temeridad de venir á Rio Nuevo con la seguridad de ser hecho prisionero; ... se me dió parte en Octubre [1810] de que se habian visto en la vigía de San Antonio dos ó tres botes: mandé al subteniente D. José Luis Melendez á hacer un reconocimento en Rio-Nuevo, lo subió y no halló huellas ni aun ramas cortadas, ni la menor señal de haber entrado hombres en él, y esto lo corrobora el que los ranchos encontrados por el capitan Melendez en Febrero último [1812], se componian de chozas pequeñísimas y muy nuevas, ... si V.S. pide informer hallará que todos han graduado allá de fraudulentos los cortes de los caballeros Hyde, y Bennet y otro, pues es punto que judicialmente se examinó y decidió en junta de magistrados por Julio del año pasado [1811]. ... En suma, los colonos Hyde y Bennet animados de su caudal, y el mulato Armstrong porque sirve á estos, se han hecho dueños de todo el rio [Nuevo], hasta el extremo de haber abusado del candor y buena fé de V.S. moviéndole con engaños á una providencia hostil de que despues trataré. Habiendo sido la mia tan moderada, que solo envié una piragua con un oficial y veinte hombres, con órdenes terminantes para usar de la mayor atencion y suavidad en un parage que era asilo de desertores y reos de otros delitos, y donde los cortadores tenian ciento ó mas negros esclavos.—V.S. en sus citados oficios considera las dos riberas de Rio-Nuevo y la meridional de Rio-Hondo, como unos terrenos á que tienen derecho los colonos ingleses y sobre que hay discusion pendiente entre los dos gobiernos. ... en mis oficios de 17 de julio de 1810 y 25 de Febrero último, no hice reclamo alguno sobre la ocupacion de muchas leguas de la ribera septentrional desde el punto donde desgua el estero negro ó *Black Creek* para arriba, ni dí por confiscadas las ochocientas piezas de caoba cortadas en la misma ribera, fundéndome en que no había camino abierto hasta la laguna del Tipú para extraerlas por Rio-Nuevo, y porque se hallaban en terreno ocupado por las fuerzas británicas aunque fuera de los límites señalados por el tratado de 83 y convencion de 86. ... He probado con claridad y solidez que los colonos ingleses no tiene derecho alguno á cortar maderas en Rio-Nuevo y Rio-Hondo, como no ocupados por las fueras británicas ni de otro modo en la última guerra; que los cortes que hay ahora en Rio-Nuevo, son recientes y fraudulentos; que sus dueños abusando de la rectitude de V.S. y fiados en que hace solo tres años que llegó á ese establecimiento, donde no encontró en su archivo la correspondencia sobre la materia con la capitanía general de esta provincia, que le diese luces sobre las verdades que llevo referidas, se han atrevido á engañarle para que dictase una providencia cuya ejecucion léjos de ser tan moderada como indican sus oficios de 22 de Febrero y 4 de Marzo, fué en extremo violenta; pues el comandante D. Juan Coatguelwin, llegó á la embocadura del Rio-Nuevo como á las tres de la tarde del 24 de Febrero con tres goletas, dos de ellas armada cada una con un cañon de grueso calibre á proa, tres obuses en las bandas y crecido número de tropas cargando sus armas; pasó á su bordo el sargento comandante del pequeño destacamento de un cabo y seis soldados que habia mandado yo á quiel punto con órdenes llenas de lenidad, respecto de los individuos para que saliesen libremente con sus equipages y armas de cazar, y con el único objeto de que no permitiese extraer las maderas justamente confiscadas; ... /v Peniche 385 /xxx"

They do not, nor can they be easily made to understand the obligations attached to their freedom. Their idea is that the King has made them free & therefore that the making them work for Six Years longer without pay is an act of injustice. I have seen a great number of them & endeavoured to explain to their comprehension the real state of the case. They do not dissent from what is told them - & they so far seem to comprehend it, that altho several had avowed a disinclinaiton to return to their work yet none have persevered in a refusal to do so. It is however quite evident that the Six Years apprenticeship has counterbalance in the estimation all the ulterior advantages held out to them by the Bill. They look to the present only & therefore finding that they are not ""to all intents & purposes set free & discharged form all manner of Slavery at once"" They neither feel benefitted or gratified at what has been done for them ...
