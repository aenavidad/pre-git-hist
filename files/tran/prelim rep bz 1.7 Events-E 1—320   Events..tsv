Only six villages of some 150 families ... remained loyal to the [Sp] crown; but of these some had fled to the forests ""either out of fear that they would be carried off by the rebels or for not being able to tolerate the weight of the work, being so few."" /via Jones 1 p210 /xxx [Bishop of Yucatán to Crown, 5 mar 1643]

All of these events [eg massacres at Tah Itza in 1623, at Sacalum in 1624], ... were the prelude ot the dramatic collapse of Spanish control over most of the Maya towns of the Bacalar province beginning in 1638, the opening year of Katun 1 Ahau. This loss of colonial control was by 1642 replaced by a regenerated Maya leadership based at Tipu. /Jones 1 p190

Complicating our understanding of the period [1638–42] are the poorly understood effects of increasing depredations of foreign pirates along the eastern coasts [of Bacalar province], which ceertainly would have stimulated coastal Mayas to seek refuge in interior locations around Tipu. These depredations, in combination with independence movements at Tipu, had devastating implications for the villa of Bacalar, which was already in a weakened state due to its administration by an absentee leadership based at Valladolid. /Jones 1 p191

These [Sp, mulattos and mestizos of Bacalar], he [Gov of Yuc] said, numbered only about 50 and were a miserable, poor lot, living by going from village to vilage selling things which they bartered for the locally produced cacao. In so doing, he claimed, they extorted the Indians. /Jones 1 p205 /MEXICO,360 [10 jul 1638]

[80 Ma from Manan and Chinam] have declared that by deceits and threats from the Indians of Tipu, by messages they had sent them that they were to give obedience to their king and wished them to abandon their town [Manan], saying that if they did not do so all would die and be finished, because at such a time the Itzas would come to kill them and there would be great mortalities and hurricanes that would flood the land. /via Jones 1 p207 /xxx [20 sep 1638] / Holpatin likewise received these reports from Tipu, per Bacalar intelligence /via Jones 1 p208"

Suspending him ... it is difficult to explain ""the irregularity of the whole of those [Sp Commissary visits] proceedings"" with the Spanish Commissary. The sole purpose of the visits by Spanish Officers is to see that no forts are erected by the Settlers, and the British commissaries accompany them to see that this purpose is fulfilled. The giving HM sanction and authority to the destruction of the Plantations by the Spanish Commissary was ""an act highly exceptionable."" Gual should have reported finding them to his superiors, as their status was doubtful and Spain has since given her consent to such cultivation. Similarly Gual should have been permitted to report the finding of the system of Magistrates to his superiors. Despard knew that the introduciton of a Plan of Police was under consideration in England. Even if Gual had been right in making the complaint and Despard had been authorised to abolish the Courts it would have been wrong to do so since the Settlement could not subsist without them and he himself proceeded to set up an alternative system ""equally liable to the objection by which you declared the former to be illegal."" /via Burdon 1 p180 /CO 123/8
